# Epic: Public User Profile Feature

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title**: Public User Profile Feature  
**Epic ID**: SAVD-001  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Planning  
**Estimated Story Points**: 21  
**Target Release**: Q1 2025  

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, SAVD users have no way to view other users' public profiles, limiting social discovery and community building within the platform. Users need a simple way to share their profile information (name, bio, photo) with others through direct URL sharing.

### Business Value
- **Community Building**: Enable users to discover and connect with other creators
- **Social Sharing**: Allow users to share their profiles externally via direct URLs
- **Platform Growth**: Increase user engagement through social features
- **User Retention**: Provide additional value through profile personalization

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 70% of active users add profile photos within 30 days
- **Profile Views**: Average of 5+ profile views per user per month
- **Engagement**: 15% increase in user session duration
- **Error Rate**: <1% error rate on profile page loads

## User Stories

### Epic User Story
**As a** SAVD user  
**I want to** view other users' public profiles by navigating to their profile URL  
**So that** I can learn more about other creators and share my own profile information  

### Acceptance Criteria
- Users can navigate to `/profile/{user_id}` to view any user's public profile
- Profile pages display user's name, bio, and photo (when available)
- Profile pages are publicly accessible without authentication
- Profile pages handle missing data gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
- Profile pages are responsive and accessible across all devices

## Technical Requirements

### Database Requirements
- Add `photo` column to existing `profiles` table
- Implement public read access RLS policy for profiles
- Ensure proper indexing for profile queries
- Support external image URL storage for photos

### API Requirements
- Create dynamic API endpoint: `GET /api/profile/[userId]`
- Implement proper UUID validation for user IDs
- Return standardized JSON responses with error handling
- Support public access without authentication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Frontend Requirements
- Create dynamic page route: `/profile/[userId]`
- Implement responsive profile display components
- Add loading states and error handling
- Support image optimization for profile photos
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Security Requirements
- Validate all user inputs (UUID format)
- Sanitize displayed data to prevent XSS
- Implement rate limiting on profile endpoints
- Only expose safe, public profile fields
- Consider future privacy controls architecture

## User Stories Breakdown

### Story 1: Database Schema Enhancement
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: None  

**As a** developer  
**I want to** add a photo column to the profiles table  
**So that** users can store profile photo URLs  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Photo column added as TEXT type to profiles table
- Column allows NULL values for users without photos
- RLS policy created for public read access to profiles
- Migration script created and tested
- Database changes deployed to staging environment

### Story 2: Public Profile API Endpoint
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Story 1  

**As a** frontend developer  
**I want to** fetch user profile data via API  
**So that** I can display public profiles on the frontend  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- API endpoint `/api/profile/[userId]` created
- UUID validation implemented for user ID parameter
- Returns profile data: id, display_name, bio, photo
- Proper error responses for invalid/missing users (400, 404, 500)
- Rate limiting implemented to prevent abuse
- API tests written and passing

### Story 3: Public Profile Page Component
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Dependencies**: Story 2  

**As a** user  
**I want to** view another user's profile by visiting their profile URL  
**So that** I can see their name, bio, and photo  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Dynamic page route `/profile/[userId]` created
- Profile displays user's name, bio, and photo
- Graceful handling of missing profile data
- Loading state while fetching profile data
- Error state for invalid/missing users
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Profile photo uses Next.js Image optimization
- Page is accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

### Story 4: Profile Photo Upload Interface
**Story Points**: 5  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Dependencies**: Story 1  

**As a** user  
**I want to** upload and update my profile photo  
**So that** others can see my photo when viewing my profile  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Photo upload interface added to profile settings
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Image validation and size limits implemented
- Photo URLs stored in database photo column
- Preview functionality before saving
- Existing profile API updated to handle photo updates

## Technical Architecture

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add photo column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS photo TEXT;

-- Add public read policy
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access to profiles"
  ON public.profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (true);
```

### API Structure
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/profile/[userId]`
- **Response Format**: JSON with success/error structure
- **Validation**: UUID format validation for userId
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses

### Frontend Architecture
- **Page Route**: `/profile/[userId]` (dynamic route)
- **Components**: ProfileHeader, ProfilePhoto, DisplayName, Bio
- **State Management**: React hooks for data fetching and state
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and fallbacks

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Public Data Exposure**: Ensure only intended data is publicly accessible
- **Performance Impact**: Profile pages may receive high traffic
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Public endpoints need careful validation

### Medium Risk
- **User Privacy Concerns**: Some users may not want public profiles
- **Image Storage Costs**: External image hosting may increase costs
- **SEO Implications**: Public pages may need SEO optimization

### Low Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: Standard web technologies used
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Following existing design patterns

## Mitigation Strategies

### Security Mitigations
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security testing and code reviews

### Performance Mitigations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed profiles
- Use CDN for profile images
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Monitor API response times and set alerts

### Privacy Mitigations
- Design architecture to support future private profile options
- Minimize data exposure to essential fields only
- Consider opt-out mechanisms for public profiles

## Dependencies
