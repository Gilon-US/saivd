## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for the SAVD App. It covers various aspects of security including file upload security, cloud storage security, API security, and infrastructure security.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Current Implementation

The current implementation of SAVD App does not include user authentication or authorization. All file uploads are anonymous and accessible to anyone with the file URL.

### Security Recommendations

1. **Implement User Authentication**:
   - Add user authentication using NextAuth.js or a similar library
   - Support multiple authentication providers (email/password, OAuth, etc.)
   - Implement proper session management

2. **Add Authorization Controls**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Restrict file uploads to authenticated users
   - Allow users to access only their own uploaded files
   - Add admin roles for system management

3. **Session Security**:
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session management
   - Implement proper session expiration and renewal
   - Add CSRF protection for all authenticated requests

## File Upload Security

### Current Implementation

The application uses pre-signed URLs for secure file uploads directly to Wasabi Cloud Storage. File validation includes:

- File type validation based on MIME type
- File size limits (default: 100MB)
- Content type validation on both client and server

### Security Risks

1. **Malicious File Uploads**:
   - Users could upload malicious files (viruses, malware, etc.)
   - Files could contain malicious scripts or exploits

2. **File Type Spoofing**:
   - Users could modify file extensions or MIME types to bypass restrictions
   - Content type validation might be insufficient

3. **Denial of Service**:
   - Multiple large file uploads could consume bandwidth and storage
   - No rate limiting on file uploads

### Security Recommendations

1. **Enhanced File Validation**:
   - Implement server-side file type validation beyond MIME types
   - Use file content inspection to verify file types
   - Scan uploaded files for malware and viruses

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Add rate limiting for file uploads (e.g., X uploads per hour)
   - Implement bandwidth throttling for large uploads
   - Add total storage limits per user

3. **File Processing Pipeline**:
   - Process uploaded files asynchronously
   - Implement a quarantine system for suspicious files
   - Generate safe previews for uploaded files

## Wasabi Cloud Storage Security

### Current Implementation

The application uses AWS SDK v3 to interact with Wasabi Cloud Storage. Security measures include:

- Pre-signed URLs with limited validity (1 hour)
- Environment variables for credentials
- Content type restrictions in pre-signed URL policies

### Security Recommendations

1. **Bucket Policies**:
   - Implement least privilege bucket policies
   - Block public access to the bucket
   - Enable bucket versioning for file recovery

2. **Access Control**:
   - Use IAM roles with minimal permissions
   - Regularly rotate access keys
   - Implement IP-based restrictions for bucket access

3. **Encryption**:
   - Enable server-side encryption for all objects
   - Implement client-side encryption for sensitive files
   - Use AWS KMS or similar for key management

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable access logging for the bucket
   - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
   - Regularly audit bucket permissions

## API Security

### Current Implementation

The application uses Next.js API routes for server-side operations. Current security measures include:

- Basic input validation for required fields
- Error handling to prevent information leakage
- Content type validation

### Security Risks

1. **No Authentication**:
   - API endpoints are publicly accessible
   - No user-specific restrictions

2. **Limited Rate Limiting**:
   - No protection against API abuse
   - Potential for DoS attacks

3. **Injection Vulnerabilities**:
   - Potential for injection attacks in file names or content types

### Security Recommendations

1. **API Authentication**:
   - Add authentication for all API endpoints
   - Implement JWT or similar token-based authentication
   - Add API keys for service-to-service communication

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting for all API endpoints
   - Use IP-based and user-based rate limits
   - Add exponential backoff for repeated failures

3. **Input Sanitization**:
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Validate and escape file names and content types
   - Implement strict schema validation for API requests

4. **Security Headers**:
   - Add security headers to API responses
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Add content security policies

## Docker Security

### Current Implementation

The application uses Docker for development and production environments. Security features include:

- Multi-stage builds for minimal image size
- Non-root user for the application container
- Container resource limits
- Health checks for monitoring

### Security Recommendations

1. **Container Hardening**:
   - Use minimal base images (e.g., Alpine)
   - Remove unnecessary packages and tools
   - Implement read-only file systems where possible
   - Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

2. **Secret Management**:
   - Use Docker secrets or environment files for sensitive data
   - Avoid hardcoding secrets in Dockerfiles or compose files
   - Implement secret rotation

3. **Network Security**:
   - Use internal networks for container communication
   - Expose only necessary ports
   - Implement network policies to restrict traffic

4. **Container Updates**:
   - Regularly update base images
   - Scan for vulnerabilities in containers
   - Implement automated container updates

## Network Security

### Current Implementation

The production setup includes Nginx as a reverse proxy with basic security configurations.

### Security Recommendations

1. **SSL/TLS Configuration**:
   - Use strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2+)
   - Implement proper cipher suites
   - Enable HSTS headers
   - Obtain and maintain valid SSL certificates
