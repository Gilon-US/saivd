## Story Structure

Each story follows a consistent structure:

2. **Story**: User story in the format "As a... I want... so that..."
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria that define when the story is complete
4. **Tasks / Subtasks**: Breakdown of implementation tasks with links to acceptance criteria
5. **Dev Notes**: Technical details and context for implementation
6. **Testing**: Testing requirements and approach
7. **Change Log**: History of changes to the story

## Development Workflow

1. Stories start in "Ready for Development" status
2. Developer updates status to "In Progress" when starting work
3. Developer implements the story according to the tasks and acceptance criteria
4. Developer updates the story with implementation details and marks tasks as completed
5. Developer changes status to "Ready for Review" when implementation is complete
6. After review and testing, the story is marked as "Done"
