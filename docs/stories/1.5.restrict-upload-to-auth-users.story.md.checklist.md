### Quick Summary
- **Story readiness**: READY
- **Clarity score**: 9/10
- **Major gaps identified**: None

### Developer Perspective
The story provides clear guidance on what needs to be implemented. A developer could implement this story as written with the provided context. The story includes:

1. Clear acceptance criteria
2. Specific tasks and subtasks with references to the acceptance criteria they fulfill
3. Relevant code snippets from architecture documents
4. Specific file paths and components to modify
5. Comprehensive testing requirements

The story is self-contained while providing appropriate references to architecture documents. The middleware implementation details are included directly in the story, which will be particularly helpful for the developer.

### Minor Suggestions (Not Blocking)
- Consider adding a note about potential edge cases for session expiration handling
- Could include more specific details about the UI components for the login page and dashboard
