# Video Deletion Feature - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **SAVD app user**,
I want **to delete my own videos with a delete option on the video card**,
So that **I can remove unwanted videos and manage my storage space effectively**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: VideoGrid component (`/src/components/video/VideoGrid.tsx`)
- Technology: React/TypeScript, Next.js API routes, Supabase, Wasabi S3
- Follows pattern: Existing video API pattern (`/src/app/api/videos/[id]/route.ts`)
- Touch points: VideoGrid UI component, existing DELETE API endpoint, useVideos hook refresh

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Each video card in the VideoGrid displays a delete button/icon that is clearly visible and accessible
2. Clicking the delete button shows a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
3. Upon confirmation, the video file is deleted from Wasabi storage and the video record is removed from the database
4. The video grid refreshes automatically after successful deletion to reflect the updated state

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing VideoGrid component functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New delete functionality follows existing React component pattern with proper error handling
7. Integration with existing DELETE `/api/videos/[id]` API endpoint maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Delete action is covered by appropriate tests (component and integration)
9. Error handling provides clear user feedback for failed deletions
10. No regression in existing video grid functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add delete button to existing VideoCard UI, utilize existing DELETE API endpoint at `/api/videos/[id]/route.ts`
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the pattern used in `handleCreateWatermark` function for user interactions and API calls
- **Key Constraints:** 
  - Users can only delete their own videos (enforced by existing API authentication)
  - Must handle both successful and failed deletion scenarios
  - Maintain responsive design of video cards

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Delete button/icon added to each video card in VideoGrid component
- [ ] Confirmation dialog implemented to prevent accidental deletions
- [ ] Delete functionality integrates with existing DELETE API endpoint
- [ ] Video grid refreshes automatically after successful deletion
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Existing video grid functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing React/TypeScript patterns and standards
- [ ] Component tests updated to cover delete functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end delete workflow

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Accidental video deletion by users
- **Mitigation:** Implement confirmation dialog with clear messaging
- **Rollback:** Feature can be disabled by removing delete button from UI; API endpoint remains unchanged

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing VideoGrid props or API
- [ ] Database changes: None required (uses existing DELETE endpoint)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns (button styling, spacing)
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (single API call per deletion)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Story can be completed in one development session (estimated 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Integration approach is straightforward (reuse existing API)
- [ ] Follows existing patterns exactly (React component patterns, API integration)
- [ ] No design or architecture work required (uses existing UI components)

**Clarity Check:**

- [ ] Story requirements are unambiguous and testable
- [ ] Integration points are clearly specified (VideoGrid component, DELETE API)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable (button visible, confirmation works, deletion succeeds)
- [ ] Rollback approach is simple (remove UI elements)

**Story Estimation:** 2-3 hours of focused development work
**Priority:** Medium
**Dependencies:** None (all required components exist)

## Dev Agent Record

### Tasks
- [x] Implement delete button UI in VideoGrid component
- [x] Create DeleteConfirmDialog component
- [x] Integrate with existing DELETE API endpoint
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for delete functionality

### Agent Model Used
Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Cascade)

### File List
**New Files:**
- `src/components/video/DeleteConfirmDialog.tsx` - Confirmation dialog component
- `src/components/video/__tests__/DeleteConfirmDialog.test.tsx` - Tests for confirmation dialog

**Modified Files:**
- `src/components/video/VideoGrid.tsx` - Added delete button and functionality
- `src/components/video/__tests__/VideoGrid.test.tsx` - Added tests for delete functionality

### Change Log
1. **Created DeleteConfirmDialog component** - Modal dialog with warning message, video filename display, and confirm/cancel actions
2. **Enhanced VideoGrid component** - Added delete button to video card header with trash icon and proper styling
3. **Implemented delete functionality** - Added state management, API integration, and error handling following existing patterns
4. **Added comprehensive tests** - Created test suites for both components covering all user interactions and edge cases
5. **Followed existing patterns** - Used same styling, error handling, and API integration patterns as `handleCreateWatermark`

### Completion Notes
- Delete button positioned in video card header with intuitive trash icon
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions with clear warning message
- Error handling provides user-friendly feedback for failed deletions
- Successful deletions automatically refresh the video grid
- All functionality follows existing React/TypeScript patterns
- Tests cover happy path, error scenarios, and loading states

### Status
Ready for Review
