## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- 1 Full-stack Developer (Next.js, Supabase)
- 1 Frontend Developer (React, Tailwind CSS)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (Docker, CI/CD)
- 1 QA Engineer (Testing)

### Infrastructure

- Supabase Project (Auth & Database)
- Wasabi Storage Account
- External Watermarking Service API Access
- Docker-compatible hosting environment

### Development Tools

- Git repository
- CI/CD pipeline
- Testing framework
- Design system (Figma or similar)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| External watermarking service reliability | Implement robust error handling and retry logic |
| Video upload performance issues | Use chunked uploads and optimize for large files |
| Database scaling challenges | Implement proper indexing and query optimization |
| Mobile compatibility issues | Test thoroughly on various devices and screen sizes |

### Project Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Timeline slippage | Build in buffer time for each phase |
| Scope creep | Strictly adhere to MVP definition |
| Resource constraints | Prioritize features based on user value |
| Integration challenges | Early prototyping of key integrations |

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Users can complete the entire workflow (upload, watermark, share, delete) without errors
2. The application performs well with videos up to the specified size limit
3. The UI is responsive and works well on mobile devices
4. All security requirements are met
5. The application can be deployed using Docker and Docker Compose
6. The system can handle the expected user load

## Post-MVP Roadmap

After successful implementation of the MVP, the following features can be considered for future phases:

1. **Batch Operations**: Select and watermark multiple videos at once
2. **Custom Watermarks**: Allow users to upload and position custom watermarks
3. **Video Preview**: In-app video playback for both original and watermarked videos
4. **Advanced Search**: Filter and search functionality for video library
5. **Usage Analytics**: Dashboard showing video uploads, watermarking, and sharing metrics
6. **Team Collaboration**: Shared video libraries with role-based permissions
