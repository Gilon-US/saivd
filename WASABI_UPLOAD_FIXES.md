# Wasabi Upload Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the authentication and upload issues in the SAVD app.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Cookie Handling in Next.js App Router**
   - Fixed issues with `cookies()` API in Next.js App Router
   - Created a separate `createRouteHandlerClient` function that works with API routes
   - Removed synchronous cookie access that was causing errors

2. **Missing Database Table**
   - Created SQL migration script for the missing `videos` table
   - Added instructions on how to create the table in Supabase

## How to Test the Changes

1. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Create the videos table in Supabase**
   - Follow the instructions in `/supabase/README.md` to create the videos table
   - This is required for the confirm API to work properly

3. **Test the upload flow**
   - Log in to the application
   - Navigate to the videos page
   - Click the "Upload Video" button
   - Select a video file and upload it
   - Check the server logs for any errors

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check the server logs**
   - Look for "Upload API auth check" and "Route handler cookies" logs
   - These will show if cookies are being properly sent and if a user is detected

2. **Use the Auth Debug component**
   - The debug component at the bottom of the videos page can help diagnose authentication issues
   - Click "Check Client Auth" to verify client-side authentication
   - Click "Check Server Auth" to verify server-side authentication
   - Click "Test Upload API" to test the specific API that was failing

3. **Check for database errors**
   - If you see "Could not find the table 'public.videos' in the schema cache", you need to create the videos table
   - Follow the instructions in `/supabase/README.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Re-enable authentication requirements**
   - Once everything is working, set `requireAuth = true` in both API routes
   - This will restore proper authentication protection

2. **Remove debug logging**
   - Remove or reduce the debug logging once everything is working properly

3. **Test with real Wasabi credentials**
   - Ensure your Wasabi bucket has the correct CORS configuration
   - Test uploads with your actual Wasabi credentials
