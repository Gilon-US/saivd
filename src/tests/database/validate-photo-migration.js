/**
 * Manual validation checklist for photo column migration
 * Story 2.1: Add Photo Column and Public Access to Profiles
 * 
 * To validate the migration, run these SQL queries in Supabase SQL Editor:
 * 
 * 1. Check photo column exists:
 *    SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
 *    FROM information_schema.columns 
 *    WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND column_name = 'photo';
 * 
 * 2. Test public read access:
 *    SELECT id, display_name, bio, photo FROM public.profiles LIMIT 5;
 * 
 * 3. Check RLS policies:
 *    SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
 *    FROM pg_policies 
 *    WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
 * 
 * 4. Verify photo column accepts NULL:
 *    SELECT COUNT(*) as null_photos FROM public.profiles WHERE photo IS NULL;
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Query 1: Should show photo column as TEXT type, nullable
 * - Query 2: Should return profile data without authentication error
 * - Query 3: Should show "Allow public read access to profiles" policy
 * - Query 4: Should return count of profiles with NULL photos
